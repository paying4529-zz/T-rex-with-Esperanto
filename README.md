## Teamwork

## Description
This is a linguistic game adapted from Google Dino, which aimed to let players get the rules of verb tenses in Esperanto.
Also, each word would be pronounced when it shows up on the screen. So players can also be familiar with the pronunciation.

### Game Rule

You can press "SPACEBAR" to jump or press "DOWN" to slide.

- You may also need to answer some questions by choosing "A" , "B" or "C".
